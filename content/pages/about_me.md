I'm Wayde Gilliam, a Fullstack ML Engineer from San Diego, California, passionate about all things deep learning, robotics, and cool tech. In my free time I'm either reading, surfing, hiking, or just trying to learn new things that *definitely* aren't a waste of time.
 
I don't post often on this website, but when I do it's to share some of the projects I've been working on (which helps me really understand what it is that I'm sharing).
